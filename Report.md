# $500 for a kitchen table and bedside sofa Report

The following is a report template to help your team successfully provide all the details necessary for your report in a structured and organised manner. Please give a straightforward and concise report that best demonstrates your project. Note that a good report will give a better impression of your project to the reviewers.

*Here are some tips to write a good report:*

* *Try to summarise and list the `bullet points` of your project as many as possible rather than give long, tedious paragraphs that mix up everything together.*

* *Try to create `diagrams` instead of text descriptions, which are more straightforward and explanatory.*

* *Try to make your report `well structured`, which is easier for the reviewers to capture the necessary information.*

*We give instructions enclosed in square brackets [...] and examples for each sections to demonstrate what are expected for your project report.*

*Please remove the instructions or examples in `italic` in your final report.*

## Summary of Individual Contributions

*[Summarise the contributions made by each member to the project, e.g. code implementation, code design, UI design, report writing, etc.]*

*[Code Implementation. Which features did you implement? Which classes or methods was each member involved in? Provide an approximate proportion in pecentage of the contribution of each member to the whole code implementation, e.g. 30%.]*

*[Code Design. What design patterns, data structures, did the involved member propose?]*

*[UI Design. Specify what design did the involved member propose? What tools were used for the design?]*

*[Report Writing. Which part of the report did the involved member write?]*

*[Slide preparation. Were you responsible for the slides?]*

*[Miscellaneous contributions. You are welcome to provide anything that you consider as a contribution to the project or team.]*

## Conflict Resolution Protocol

If the conflict is strictly one of opinion, the group will hold a democratic vote to determine the best course of action for the project. If this vote ends in a tie, the tie-breaker will come from the group member who has been assigned that particular component of the project. (e.g., if the conflict is about the UI, Xingkun will be the tiebreaker vote).

If the conflict is more of personality, we will try to resolve things through conversation, or if really necessary get a third-party person to mediate (e.g., tutor or maybe another unrelated person from the group).

## Application Description

Our application is a messaging/social media app aimed at helping people who want to practice new languages. Each user first creates an account wherein they specify the language they are fluent in and the language they would like to learn. The app then matches users against each other based on language fluency and which language each user would like to learn.

**Application Use Cases and or Examples**

Target Users: Students or amateur learners of a new language.

A use case of this application is in the case of two students wanting to practice a language taught in school.

1. George is fluent in English but is learning Spanish in school
2. Amy is fluent in Spanish but is learning English in school
3. Both George and Amy want to practice the languages they are learning in school
4. George and Amy create an account of the language learning app and match each other
5. George and Amy chat and improve their understanding of each other's language

## Application UML

![ClassDiagramExample](./images/ClassDiagramExample.png)
*[Replace the above with a class diagram. You can look at how we have linked an image here as an example of how you can do it too.]*

## Application Design and Decisions

*Please give clear and concise descriptions for each subsections of this part. It would be better to list all the concrete items for each subsection and give no more than `5` concise, crucial reasons of your design. Here is an example for the subsection `Data Structures`:*

*I used the following data structures in my project:*

1. *LinkedList*

   * *Objective: It is used for storing xxxx for xxx feature.*

   * *Locations: line xxx in XXX.java, ..., etc.*

   * *Reasons:*

     * *It is more efficient than Arraylist for insertion with a time complexity O(1)*

     * *We don't need to access the item by index for this feature*

2. ...

3. ...

**Data Structures**

*[What data structures did your team utilise? Where and why?]*

**Design Patterns**

- DAO pattern: Our team uses the DAO pattern to retrieve, store and update data stored in the Firebase database.

**Grammar(s)**

<br> *Production Rules* <br>
\<Non-Terminal> ::= \<some output>
<br>
\<Non-Terminal> ::= \<some output>

*[How do you design the grammar? What are the advantages of your designs?]*

*If there are several grammars, list them all under this section and what they relate to.*

**Tokenizer and Parsers**

*[Where do you use tokenisers and parsers? How are they built? What are the advantages of the designs?]*

**Surprise Feature**
Code Smells
Potential:
  - returning private field from public class (User class, friendship request) (leaky encapsulation) - https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/495.html
    - First commit: 2c2a096df05bc1ee5e74a1c79160094041051f7d, 22/4, lines 21, 24, 32, 40, 58 (User class), 
    - fixable: yes!
    - Fixed commit: TBD
  - public static fields should be final (QueuedUserObserver) - https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/500.html
    - First commit: 1f9976d345c1ed9a82d161259c5e4f95d4af790c, 24/4, line 5
    - fixable: yes!
    - Fixed commit: TBD
  - potential god class: User class
    - fixable: probably not... (if someone thinks of a way to fix this feel free to update =D)
    - reasons: all of the functionality makes sense to be in user class
            making multiple objects has high potential to cause "unnecessary abstraction"/"broken modularization" code smell
            as a countermeasure, be especially vigilant when adding new fields or methods to User class
**Other**

*[What other design decisions have you made which you feel are relevant? Feel free to separate these into their own subheadings.]*

## Summary of Known Errors and Bugs

1. *Bug 1:* Empty messages and those with newlines can be sent in ConversationActivity. This has only incorrect visual feedback.

2. *Bug 2:* Empty or invalid usernames (like those containing `.` or `#` or `[` or `]`) are usable

3. *Bug 3:* Exiting the conversation by closing the app rather than pressing the exit button keeps it active in memory, but you cannot rejoin.

4. *Bug 4:* Users may log in concurrently to the same account on two different devices, causing wacky results in they queue together.

*List all the known errors and bugs here. If we find bugs/errors that your team does not know of, it shows that your testing is not thorough.*

## Testing Summary

Number of test cases: 15+61

Code coverage: `ConversationFormer.java`, `QueuedUserObserver.java`

Types of tests created: We have tested many of the back-end algorithmic features, but little of the database connections or the GUI.





*Please provide some screenshots of your testing summary, showing the achieved testing coverage. Feel free to provide further details on your tests.*

## Implemented Features

User Interactivity
1. The ability to micro-interact with items in your app (e.g. like/dislike/support/report a
post/message/event) [stored in-memory]. (easy)

Greater Data Usage, Handling and Sophistication
2. User profile activity containing a media file (image, animation (e.g. gif), video). (easy)

Peer to Peer Messaging
1. Provide users with the ability to message each other or an institution directly (e.g., a
user can message an event/movement that is managed by another user). (hard)

Firebase Integration
1. Feature 1: Use Firebase to implement user Authentication/Authorisation (easy)
2. Use Firebase to persist all data used in your app (this item replaces the requirement to
retrieve data from a local file) (medium)
3. Using Firebase or another remote database to store user information and having the
app updated as the remote database is updated without restarting the application. E.g.
User A makes a transfer, user B on a separate instance of the application sees user Aâ€™s
transfer appear on their app instance without restarting their application. (very hard)
